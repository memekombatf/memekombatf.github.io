                    <h2>HOW STAKING WORKS

</h2>
<p>The point of $MK isn't to just buy and trade, but to stake your token in Meme Kombat and bet on battles for the chance to win big! Alongside our regular battles we will also have larger, more hyped battles for people to participate in with large prizes for winners.

</p>
                    

                    

                    <strong>50% PRESALE

</strong><p>Half of total token supply will be set aside for the $MK presale. The intention is for all who buy presale to participate in Meme Kombat.

</p>

                    
                    

                    <strong>10% DEX

</strong>
<p>10% of the overall supply is reserved for pairing with a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange.

</p>

<strong>30% STAKING &amp; BATTLE REWARDS

</strong>
<p>We have set aside a large percentage of the supply to support that ecosystem and help maintain balance.

</p>
<strong>10% COMMUNITY REWARDS
</strong>
<p>$MK is all about participation and community engagement through the love of epic battles. So we have set aside a good amount of tokens for community rewards.

</p>



<h3>Future Development
